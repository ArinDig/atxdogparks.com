# Google AdSense Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Google AdSense on your ATX Dog Parks website.

## Prerequisites Completed ‚úÖ

Your website now has all the required components for AdSense:

- ‚úÖ **Privacy Policy** - `/privacy`
- ‚úÖ **Terms of Service** - `/terms`
- ‚úÖ **Contact Page** - `/contact`
- ‚úÖ **Cookie Consent Banner** - Automatically displays to new visitors
- ‚úÖ **ads.txt file** - `/public/ads.txt` (needs your Publisher ID after approval)

## Step 1: Apply for Google AdSense

1. Go to [https://www.google.com/adsense](https://www.google.com/adsense)
2. Click **"Get Started"**
3. Sign in with your Google account
4. Enter your website URL: `https://atxdogparks.com`
5. Select your country/region
6. Review and accept the AdSense Terms and Conditions

## Step 2: Connect Your Site to AdSense

After applying, Google will provide you with an AdSense code. You'll need to add this to your website.

### Add AdSense Code to Your Site

1. In your AdSense account, copy the AdSense code (it looks like this):

```html
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

2. Open `app/layout.tsx` in your code editor

3. Add the script to the `<head>` section by modifying the layout:

```typescript
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        {/* Google AdSense */}
        <script 
          async 
          src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
          crossOrigin="anonymous"
        />
      </head>
      <body className="min-h-screen flex flex-col bg-gray-50">
        <Header />
        <main className="flex-grow">
          {children}
        </main>
        <Footer />
        <CookieConsent />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

4. Replace `ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Publisher ID

## Step 3: Update ads.txt File

Once you receive your Publisher ID from Google:

1. Open `/public/ads.txt`
2. Find the line: `# google.com, pub-PUBLISHER_ID, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0`
3. Uncomment it (remove the `#`) and replace `PUBLISHER_ID` with your actual ID

Example:
```
google.com, pub-1234567890123456, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
```

4. Commit and push the changes to GitHub
5. The file will be accessible at `https://atxdogparks.com/ads.txt`

## Step 4: Wait for Approval

- Google will review your site (typically 1-2 weeks, but can take longer)
- During this time, ensure your site has:
  - ‚úÖ Quality content (you have 16 dog park listings!)
  - ‚úÖ Easy navigation (completed)
  - ‚úÖ Privacy policy (completed)
  - ‚úÖ Contact information (completed)
  - Regular traffic (keep promoting your site!)

## Step 5: Create Ad Units (After Approval)

Once approved, you can create ad units:

1. In AdSense, go to **Ads** ‚Üí **By ad unit**
2. Choose ad type:
   - **Display ads** - Traditional banner ads
   - **In-feed ads** - Ads that match your content style
   - **In-article ads** - Ads within content
   - **Multiplex ads** - Grid of ads

### Recommended Ad Placements for Your Site:

#### Homepage (`app/page.tsx`)
- **Top Banner** - Below hero section
- **In-feed ads** - Between dog park cards (every 6 cards)
- **Sidebar ad** - If you add a sidebar

#### Individual Park Pages (`app/parks/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- **Top of page** - After park name/image
- **Mid-content** - After features section
- **Bottom** - Before related parks

### Example: Adding an Ad Unit

After creating an ad unit in AdSense, you'll get code like this:

```typescript
// Create a new component: components/AdUnit.tsx
'use client';

import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function AdUnit({ 
  slot, 
  format = 'auto',
  responsive = true 
}: { 
  slot: string;
  format?: string;
  responsive?: boolean;
}) {
  useEffect(() => {
    try {
      ((window as any).adsbygoogle = (window as any).adsbygoogle || []).push({});
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('AdSense error:', err);
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="my-4">
      <ins
        className="adsbygoogle"
        style={{ display: 'block' }}
        data-ad-client="ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        data-ad-slot={slot}
        data-ad-format={format}
        data-full-width-responsive={responsive.toString()}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Then use it in your pages:

```typescript
import AdUnit from '@/components/AdUnit';

// In your page component:
<AdUnit slot="1234567890" />
```
