        "text": "Winter weather can exacerbate conditions like arthritis in older dogs. If your senior dog seems stiff or reluctant to play during cold weather park visits, consult your veterinarian about pain management options. Shorter, more frequent visits may be more comfortable than long sessions during cold months. The goal is maintaining your dog's physical and mental health through regular exercise while respecting their comfort and limitations."

Dog parks require reliable recall, meaning your dog consistently comes when called even with distractions present. If your dog ignores commands during regular walks, they are not ready for the highly stimulating park environment. Dogs also need basic socialization skills and comfort around other dogs before park visits.

Move promptly away from the entry area after releasing your dog so they do not develop a habit of mobbing new arrivals. If your dog rushes gates, work on recall specifically in this context.

Keep your veterinarian's number and the nearest emergency vet clinic information easily accessible on your phone. Carry a basic first aid kit in your car with items like gauze, antiseptic, tweezers, and a emergency contact card."

Instead, try loud noises, water from a hose or bottle, or grabbing hind legs to separate dogs (multiple people should act simultaneously). After any incident, even minor ones, check your dog thoroughly for injuries that might not be immediately apparent. Small puncture wounds can become serious infections if not properly cleaned and monitored. When in doubt, consult your veterinarian."
