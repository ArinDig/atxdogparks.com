- See which keywords bring traffic to your site
- Identify and fix technical SEO issues
- Monitor mobile usability
- Check indexing status

## Step 1: Add Your Property to Search Console

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Add Property"**
4. Choose **"URL prefix"** method
5. Enter: `https://atxdogparks.com`
6. Click **Continue**

---

## Step 2: Verify Ownership

Google offers several verification methods. Here are the easiest options for your Vercel-hosted site:

### Method A: HTML Tag (Recommended - Easiest)

1. Google will give you a meta tag like:
   ```html
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="XXXXXXXXXXXXXX" />
   ```

2. **Update your site's metadata:**
   
   Open `app/layout.tsx` and find the line:
   ```typescript
   verification: {
     google: 'your-google-verification-code',
   },
   ```

3. Replace `'your-google-verification-code'` with just the content value (the XXXXXXXXXXXXXX part)

4. Commit and push to GitHub, wait for Vercel deployment

5. Go back to Search Console and click **"Verify"**

### Method B: HTML File Upload

1. Google will give you an HTML file to download (e.g., `google1234567890abcdef.html`)

2. Place this file in your `/public` directory:
   ```
   /public/google1234567890abcdef.html
   ```

3. Commit and push to GitHub

4. The file will be accessible at: `https://atxdogparks.com/google1234567890abcdef.html`

5. Click **"Verify"** in Search Console

### Method C: DNS Record (If you manage DNS)

1. Google will give you a TXT record to add to your domain DNS

2. Go to GoDaddy DNS management

3. Add a new TXT record with the value provided by Google

4. Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation

5. Click **"Verify"** in Search Console

---

## Step 3: Submit Your Sitemap

Once verified, submit your sitemap to help Google index your pages faster:

1. In Google Search Console, go to **Sitemaps** (in left sidebar)

2. Enter your sitemap URL:
   ```
   https://atxdogparks.com/sitemap.xml
   ```

3. Click **Submit**

### Your Sitemap Includes:

âœ… Homepage (priority: 1.0)
âœ… About page (priority: 0.5)
âœ… Contact page (priority: 0.6)
âœ… Privacy Policy (priority: 0.3)
âœ… Terms of Service (priority: 0.3)
âœ… All 16 dog park pages (priority: 0.8)

**Total: 21 pages in your sitemap**

Google will process it within a few hours to a few days.

---

## Step 4: Submit Your robots.txt

Your site already has a `robots.txt` file at:
```
https://atxdogparks.com/robots.txt
```

You can verify it's working by visiting that URL after deployment.

The robots.txt tells search engines:
- Which pages to crawl
- Where to find your sitemap
- Crawl rate limits (if needed)

---

## Step 5: Monitor Your Site's Performance

#### 5. **URL Inspection Tool**

- Request indexing for new pages
- See how Google sees your pages

## Step 6: Request Indexing for Important Pages

After verification, manually request indexing for key pages:

1. Use the URL Inspection tool
2. Enter a URL (e.g., `https://atxdogparks.com`)
3. Click **"Request Indexing"**

**Pages to prioritize:**
- Homepage: `https://atxdogparks.com`
- Top dog parks (Zilker, Auditorium Shores, etc.)
- About page: `https://atxdogparks.com/about`

4. Choose notification preferences

You'll be alerted about:
